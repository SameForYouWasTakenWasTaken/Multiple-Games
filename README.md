# Multiple-Games

## Check recent updates at [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)!

Hello! This is one of my first actual projects here on github. It includes many games that you can try out YOURSELF.

In order to play a game, you must go to the [games](games) file and then from there you will see 2 folders - EXE_Files and CPP_Files. CPP_Files is the source code to all of the games, while EXE_Files are the games themselves that you can download and play.

If you wouldn't like to install each file individually, you can try out the [Full_Package.exe](Full_Package.exe) file. It has all of the games I created combined into one.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

If are planning on installing the full package, you **MUST** have the entire games file in the same folder, or at least the games file with the EXE_Files folder.

The full package gets all of the **.exe**'s from the **games** folder and the **EXE_Files** folder, so if you don't have them, then tough luck.

This is being set as a temporary change, probably.
